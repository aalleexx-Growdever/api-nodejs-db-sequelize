"# api-nodejs-db-sequelize" 

  First of all, you will need to download the project and install the node/modules pack with the code "yarn install" at the cmd.
  I do not have much experience using github, so probably I forgot some things or I am doing the updates and posts wrongly, please forgive me if I did it incorrecly.
  Do you have some tips for me or my code? Please send me, I will appreciate a bunch! Thanks!
